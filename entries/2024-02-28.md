# Replace Ptr with Array

Previously, I had been thinking about pointers and arrays like this:

    Base
      = Object ObjTy
      | Array
    Ptr   : Base -> * -> * 
    Array :         * -> *

Pointers accepted an additional argument, the base object. I believe I had
only considered this solution because I had been thinking that pointers
should be a second-class type, not eligible for use as fields. However,
if we drop that constraint, then we can do this instead:

    Parent = None | Some ObjTy
    Array : Parent -> * -> *

Now, we have:

    new : Int -> a -> MutableArray None a
    index : Array p a -> Int -> a
    sum : Array p Int -> Int -> Int
    freeze : MutableArray None a -> Array None a

Here are illustrations of a `view` primitive that does not have a type that
can be expressed:

    Value = ...
    Node = record { height: Int, children : unpacked Array (Either Node Value) }
    myNode : Node
    view(myNode,children) : Array (Some Node) (Either Node Value)
    mutNode = allocate(Node, ...) : MutableNode
    view(mutNode,children) : MutableArray (Some Node) (Either Node Value)
    unview(mutNode) : MutableNode
    unview : MutableArray (Some p) a -> p

Now we can use a single array type for everything. Pretty cool.
