# Join Point Context Reset on RHS of Let Bind

In the join points paper, you lose access to all of your join points on
the RHS of a let binding. For example:

    label onfail(n): ...
    let foo = ...
    let bar = case r of
          True -> 12
          False -> onfail(55)
    let baz = ...

This does not typecheck. It must be rewritten to:

    label onfail(n): ...
    let foo = ...
    case r of
      True ->
        let bar = 12
        let baz = ...
      False -> onfail(55)

I'm not sure if this is a bad thing or not. It forces the user to nest certain
constructs, eating up their screen with indentation. But at least it's clear
what it going on. With the `map` and `for` constructs from 2021-10-07, the
use of epilogue might actually be required for loops that want access to labels
that they can jump out to.
