# Different Ways to Represent Pointers

I think the ideas in this post should be applicable to a high-level language
or to a C, since they fit in with its abstract machine.

The first idea is that every different object type goes in a different memory
region. Pointers are represented as 32-bit offsets into these regions. For
types that require 8-byte alignment, you get to store 32GB of them. Objects
of an unknown type (polymorphism in FP and `void*` in C) also represented as
an offset. To support garbage collection, the type must be present at runtime.
Then, the full pointer could be reconstructed.

The second (incompatible) idea is to represent all pointers as offsets from
the containing object. If there is no containing object (e.g. a local
variable), then the pointer is represented as a resolved address. This
makes is possible to `mmap` files that include objects with pointers since
a strongly connected component can be relocated. In this approach, you only
get 16GB total, even if everything is 8-byte aligned, because you have to
consider the possibility that a member B of object A could be ahead of or
behind object A in memory.

Unfortunately, I do not believe that it is possible to combine these ideas.
I would like to have something that gives you the large address space of the
first and the relocatable data of the second (and the 32-bit pointers of
both).
