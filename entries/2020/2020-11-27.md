# Linear State Token Escape

GHC Haskell makes it possible to perform in-place mutation with `ST`. This
system prevents the escape of mutable variables by giving `runST` the
type `runST : (forall s. ST s a) -> a`. In a system with linear types,
higher-rank types are not needed. Instead, we have:

    Token : Linear
    run : forall (a : Nonlinear). (Token -> (Token, a)) -> a
    writeArray : (MutArray a, Int, a, Token) -> Token

To make this easier to use, the tokens could be threaded though with a linear
state-like monad. It seems like there might be a problem: the `Token` from an
outer `run` can be used inside an inner `run`. For example:

    foo : Int
    foo = run
      (\t0 -> run
        (\t1 ->
          let (t2,dst) = newArray (t1,42,True) in
          let t3 = writeArray (dst,3,False,t0) in
      ...

Here, an array is created with one state token but written to with a different
one. Fortunately, there is nothing that can fill out the rest of `foo` that
will make it typecheck. Both `t2` and `t3` have to be used, but `run` only allows
a single linear value to be returned.

It is still important to separate deterministic effects (GHC's `ST`) from
nondetermistic effects (GHC's `IO`). After all, we cannot go calling `recv`
or `writev` inside of `run`. GHC does this by tagging `State#` with a phantom
type. I am not sure if there is a good way to enforce this distinction without
resorting to phantom types.
