# Targetting C

It is possible to use C as a target for a strict functional language.
The important things are:

* Use Henderson's shadow stack for GC roots on the stack. Before any
  function call, push GC roots to the shadow stack. After function calls,
  reload GC roots from the shadow stack.
* Use `goto` for most control flow. Have blocks for allocating that
  push pointers onto the shadow stack, call the GC, and jump back
  to the original place that called them. I'm not sure if these
  GC blocks can be shared on if one per allocation is needed.

That's it. In Henderson's paper, the reloading is left implicit in variable
accesses. Experimentally, I've found that in allocating loops, this causes
GCC to create blocks that needlessly reload from the shadow stack. Basically,
we want to pull things into registers in the (seldom taken) allocate block,
not in the loop body that's doing the real work.
