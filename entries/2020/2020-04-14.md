# Sharing Analysis outside of Clean

In Uniqueness Typing Simplified, we find this example:

    f arr = if isEmpty arr⊗
      then shrink arr⊙
      else grow arr⊙

This requires sharing analysis to work correctly, but sharing analysis
in Clean is gnarly. It there a better way to do this? The paper suggests
using a Rank-2 type:

    f ::∀ v.(∀ u. Array^u) → Array^v

This is correct, but what is going to happen when the element type in
the array is polymorphic in its uniqueness? I'm not sure. There are
three meaningful combinations:

* Shared array, shared elements
* Unique array, shared elements
* Unique array, unique elements

The fourth possibility, shared array with unique elements, does not make
sense and should be avoided. In effect, it is equivalent to a shared
array with shared elements, since the elements are not actually unique
if they are in a shared array.
