# GCC Combining Store Operations

From this C code:

    #include <stdint.h>
    #include <stdlib.h>

    struct Foo {
      int64_t w;
      int64_t x;
      int32_t y;
      int32_t z;
    };
    
    struct Foo* makeFoo(int64_t a) {
      struct Foo* r = malloc(sizeof(struct Foo));
      r->w = a;
      r->x = 1000;
      r->y = 42;
      r->z = 51;
      return r;
    }

GCC combines the writes to `r->y` and `r->z` when using `-O2`:

    makeFoo:
    .LFB18:
    .cfi_startproc
    pushq   %rbx
    .cfi_def_cfa_offset 16
    .cfi_offset 3, -16
    movq    %rdi, %rbx
    movl    $24, %edi
    call    malloc@PLT
    movabsq $219043332138, %rdx
    movq    %rbx, (%rax)
    movq    $1000, 8(%rax)
    movq    %rdx, 16(%rax)
    popq    %rbx
    .cfi_def_cfa_offset 8
    ret
    .cfi_endproc

Notice the `movabsq` instruction, used to load large constants into a
register. I wonder if it is ever worth it to do something like this
with 256-bit stores. The whole thing would need to be constant, and
it is not possible to refer to values that large in instructions, so
it would need to become either load+store or some series of instructions
that builds the value in the wide register and then performs a single
store. I am skeptical that either of these are generally a performance
win.
