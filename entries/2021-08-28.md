# Packing Arrays Implicitly

What if array element size was just managed implicitly instead of explicitly?
This has the advantage of being way more easy to use, but it has the disadvantage
of being difficult to reason about. And interop with C could be confusing. The
idea is that any time you have:

    Array (Word | >=0, <256)

We make a guarantee that all elements are stored as 8-bit words.
