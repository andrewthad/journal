# Growing LXD Container Volume Backed By LVM Thin Pool

I need to grow two things:

1. A logical volume (backed by an LVM thin pool)
2. The ext4 filesystem on that volume

The first one was easy: `lvextend` worked as expected. But the second one was
nearly impossible. I couldn't reference the file system from either the host
or the container. I noticed that if I stopped the container with lxc, then
the file system it used for storage became unmounted. But also, the device
(listed by `lsblk`) corresponding to the logical volume disappeared as well,
and without the device, it's not possible to use `resize2fs`.

What I had not understood was the extent to which LXC manages storage. If you
give LXC an LVM thin pool to use as storage, LXC aggressively manages all the
logical volumes inside the thin pool, and you need to use LXC's commands for
everything. Finally, I found the command:

    lxc config device set ubuntu-20 root size=45GB

This performs `lvextend` and `resize2fs` under the hood.
