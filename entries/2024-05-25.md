# Full Monomorphize

Monomorphization, as a compilation strategy, has advantages and disadvantages.
I want to focus on one particular difficult that I have noticed. Several
built-in types (like Array) need to be polymorphic. That is, we cannot just
have Int32Array, Int16Array, etc. because there would be an infinite number
of array types. So we need a single array type constructor and polymorphic
functions for all operations on arrays. The polymorphic functions must only
be applied to known types.

We would need an infinite number of variants of these types, so the only
functions that can be handled in this way are cheap functions that need
to be inlined into every site. This includes indexing into arrays, writing
to arrays, etc.

I think that it might be necessary to introduce type-to-function functors
to get enough power to do what I want.
