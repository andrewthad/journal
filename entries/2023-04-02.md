# Refinement Types for Array Bounds

Refinement types without true dependent types:

    index :
         (n : Nat)
      -> Array a | .len = n
      -> Int | .self >= 0, .self < n
      -> a

Problem:

    (Array Person | .len = n, Array Person | .len = 2*n)

If we have `ix | .self >= 0, .self < n`, what is the type of
`2*ix`? Probably something like:

    2 * ix : Int | .self >= 0, .self < 2*n - 1

Scrutinizing a number refines its type:

    // k : Int | R
    case k of
      0 -> ... // k : Int | R, .self = 0
      _ -> ... // k : Int | R, .self != 0

Inequality is tricky since it implies disjunction. But I think it is
possible for it to work out fine.

# Limitations

What doesn't work well in this system? Relationships between several
numbers. There is a step in merge sort that require two indices, the
first of which is smaller:

    step : Int -> Int -> MutArr a -> IO ()

In `step`, we must compute the midpoint. We want to know that the mipoint
is between the indices, and we want to know that it is a valid index into
the array. With this system, we have to use unsafe arithmetic. Our
refinements are too weak to prove what we want to know.
