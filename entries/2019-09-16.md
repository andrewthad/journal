I was thinking about using perfect hashing to accelerate keyword reconition
in tokenizers. In the [Hacker News discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18879185)
of a mailing list thread about [doing this very thing in pgsql](https://www.postgresql.org/message-id/flat/E1ghOVt-0007os-2V%40gemulon.postgresql.org),
someone linked to [Schnell's very approachable explanation](http://ilan.schnell-web.net/prog/perfect-hash/algo.html)
of the CHM92 algorithm. This algorithm uses a graph, which reminded me of
the [algebraic-graphs](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/algebraic-graphs-0.4) on hackage
and the [functional pearl](https://dl.acm.org/authorize.cfm?key=N46678) it is based on.

The `algrebraic-graphs` library is rather large. It includes several
representations of graphs, several typeclasses (some of which are methodless
and just imply additional laws), and some example modules. To some, this
is probably an asset (there's decent community interaction on the GitHub
issue tracker), but the large scope of the library it less appealing
to me. What I find most interesting is this type:

    data Graph a
      = Empty
      | Vertex a
      | Overlay (Graph a) (Graph a)
      | Connect (Graph a) (Graph a)

I think of this as a "free graph" ("free" as in "free Monad") although
using that term in this context is certainly wrong. It preserves too
much structure. That is, it preserves the whole construction of
the graph, but there are multiple ways to construct the same graph.
The paper mentions the derived `Eq` instance of `Graph` is not useful,
and this overpreservation of information is why.

What am I interested in though? I like this type-safe graph data type.
It's super cool. I don't care as much about the typeclasses or the
adjacency-list representation of graphs. Variations I'm interested
in are:

* Monomorphize the vertex to `Int`. If we make the vertex always be `Int`,
  we can unpack it into the data constructor. Also, we wouldn't
  have to pass typeclass dictionaries around everywhere. We could
  do this with backpack instead, but `Int` is a rather common
  choice as a vertex type, and several algorithms assume `Int`
  keys. Users could always build a bidirectional map to perform
  the conversion at the edge.
* Monomorphize the vertex to `STRef s ()`. I don't think this
  would actually work out well in practice, but `STRef` gives
  us the ability to easily conjure up fresh identifiers.
  Unfortunately, there is no `Ord` instance for `STRef s a`
  which would make certain algorithms really slow. In
  [pull request #12](https://github.com/ekmett/discrimination/pull/12) on
  [discrimination](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/discrimination),
  Edward Kmett mentions that unordered discrimination on `IORef`
  (and consequently `STRef`) should be possible. However, it
  is not implementated. I've seen Edward mention elsewhere
  that a technique for hashing things that can be moved by
  the GC is to use the starting location as a hash. Found it.
  He does this in [unique](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/unique-0).
  This should be possible with `STRef` as well which means
  that hashing them should work. Still, I'm not sure that
  using these in graphs would buy very much.
* Implement algorithms to operate directly on the type-safe
  structure-preserving graph. For example, testing for
  cycles not difficult (I think a partition refinement data
  structure would be needed).
