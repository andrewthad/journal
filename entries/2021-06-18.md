# Mostly Tagless Garbage Collection

This is a novel idea for an automatic memory management scheme that tags
data in a young generation (nursery) and does not tag data in an old
generation. Note that disjoint unions must always have some kind of tag,
and this scheme does not eliminate those tags. It does, however, eliminate
most tags for single-data-constructor types.

The goal is to fully reconstruct the type of any object before evacuating
it. Then, the object may be evacuated to a block that only contains objects
of that same type. In a language that does not support polymorphism,
type reconstruction is trivial. Just inspect a tag, and that tag tells
you the type. With polymorphism on the table, we have to think a little
harder. The tags in the nursery can tell you the type constructor
(e.g. `List`, `Person`, `Map`), but they cannot tell you the full type,
that is, the application of the type constructor to all relevant argument
types.
