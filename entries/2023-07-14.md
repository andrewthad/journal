# More Simple Tracking of Natural Numbers

I keep going down a rabbit hole of complicated systems for dealing with natural
numbers. Here's what I think I should actually do:

    index : {n : Nat} -> Vector n a -> (Nat | ? <= n - 1) -> a
    replicate : (n : Nat) -> a -> Vector n a
    permute : Vector n a -> Vector m (Nat | ? <= n - 1) -> Vector m a
    sort : Vector n Foo -> Vector n Foo
    filter : (a -> Bool) -> Vector n a -> ((m : Nat | ? <= n), Vector m a)

The last one, `filter`, is a little odd. We want to be able to express that
a vector is smaller than another one.

Should `Nat` have refinements? Compare these:

    index : {n : Nat} -> Vector n a -> (Int | ? >= 0, ? <= n - 1) -> a
    index : {n : Nat} -> Vector n a -> (Nat | ? <= n - 1) -> a

For `index`, it looks like using `Int` might be better. What about `filter`?

    filter : (a -> Bool) -> Vector n a -> (m : Nat, Vector m a, m <= n)
    filter : (a -> Bool) -> Vector n a -> (m : Nat, p : Nat, Vector m a, n = m + p)
    filter : (a -> Bool) -> Vector n a -> ((m : Nat | ? <= n), Vector m a)

I like the middle one the most because with `n = m + p` in scope, the
typechecker can reason that `Int | ? <= m` can be weakened to `Int | ? <= n`.

One advantage to having `Int` and `Nat` be different types is that we can
restrict the range of `Nat` to be something like [0,2^31-1]. We probably
want to do this because the intent is that `Nat` is the size of an array, and
giant arrays should not be supported. If we add two `Int`s that are bounded
both bounded by `Nat`s and if `Nat` cannot be arbitrarily large, then the
integer addition doesn't need to be checked for overflow.

How can we say that a `Nat` is below some bound:

    a : Nat, b : Nat, a + b = 1000

Now we have an upper bound on both `a` and `b`. Sometimes, we will need to
convert an `Int` to a `Nat`, and this will always require checking that it
is not too big (or negative). That's ok. This shouldn't happen often,
hopefully only when sanitizing user input.
