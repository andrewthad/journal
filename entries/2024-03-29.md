# Type System for Struct Types And Object Types

The way I had been thinking about doing this was:

    Construction = { ... } // mapping from data constructors to fields
    Modality = Immutable | Mutable | Struct
    Type = MkType Construction Modality

This approach works. It makes it possible to abstract over constructions,
but this flexibility is not useful. We can tweak the design:

    Construction = { ... }
    Storage = Heap | Struct
    struct : Construction -> Type
    heap : Construction -> Mutability -> Type

# Type Constructors and Structs and Objects

Consider the list type:

    functor(Type) object 
      { Cons = { head = @0, tail = ^0 }
      , Nil = {}
      }

It's kind is `Type Immutable -> (m : Mutability) -> Type m`. If structs do
not support mutability, then an equivalent struct ends up with kind
`Type Immutable -> Type Immutable`. This is a problem. It makes it difficult
to use these type constructors as arguments to the same functor. We need
to be able to talk about types with the struct/object distinction but
without mutability:

    Storage = Heap | Struct
    Construction = MkConstruction Storage { ... }
    Type = MkType Mutability Construction

And now the type of `List` is `Type Immutable -> Construction`. And the
set of prohibited data constructors should be in `MkType`:

    Type = MkType Mutability (Set DataCon) Construction

This means that whenever we talk about constructed types, we need a
`mut` or `imm` prefix with them. We also need a syntax for talking
about prohibited data constructors.
