# Default Cases

In Haskell, we do this:

    case x of
      Foo a b -> ...
      Bar a -> ...
      _ -> ...

In the language I'm thinking of, I'd like to do this instead:

    case x of
      [Foo] y -> 
      [Bar] y -> 
      [Baz,Bang] -> 

Let's see what this looks like with more brackets:

    case.constructed x
      { [Foo] x = ...
      , [Bar] x = ...
      , [Baz,Bang] = ...
      }
