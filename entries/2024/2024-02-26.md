# Other Strategy for Masking Out Constructors

At the end of the entry from 2024-02-25, I described a system for supporting
both deep and shallow data constructor masking. It involved tracking masking
in two places. Here is another strategy:

    data Masking = Top | Recursive
    data Constructed = Constructed
      Mutability
      (Map ConstructorId ConstructionDescription)
      -- ^ full data constructor descriptions 
      (Map ConstructorId Masking)
      -- ^ data constructor prohibitions, absence from this map implies no prohibition

This is better than what I was doing before. There is a natural way to
combine the masking information when we take the union of two types.
One minor issue is that non-recursive types do not actually need two
different masking possibilities. That is fine, and we can just disallow
the use of `Recursive` on such types.

# Similarities with Stack Allocation

There is something similar between this and some of the strategies for
tracking stack allocation. In both cases, we want to:

* Ask if something is true at only the top level
* Ask if something is true at all levels

Actually, there may not be much similarity here. With stack allocation
tracking, we want to get an upper bound on the stack frame that the
data might live at, and this upper bound is always pushed down recursively.
