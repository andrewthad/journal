# Computing Field Positions, Continued

Continuing from 2024-08-13.

I have thought of a shortcut that I can take. I want to take advantage
of these properties: Most polymorphic types only have a single type
argument, and a few have two type arguments. Similarly, most data
constructors do not have a variable-length array.

Let's define a "strategy" for each field. The strategy tells us how
to get from the base object address to the address of the field.
Here are some possible strategies:

* Constant: The field is located at a fixed position. This might be
  the case for `Cons` depending on what kind of alignment rules we have.
* Lookup: Put a type argument (a size) into a lookup table to find the
  position of the field. Each field has its own lookup table, so these
  are not cache friendly.

The constant strategy might not be useful if we are serious about aligning
16-byte and 32-byte values. So we might only want the lookup strategy, and
if we do that for all the fields, we should put them all together. That is,
the strategy should be for the entire object, not just for a field.

VLAs are a serious problem. Maybe just give up on these. These are more useful
in languages that prioritize immutability, and I've been slowly moving away
from immutability.

How many sizes do we need? Maybe these:

* 1 byte
* 2 bytes (alignment: 1)
* 2 bytes (alignment: 2)
* 4 bytes (alignment: 1)
* 4 bytes (alignment: 2)
* 4 bytes (alignment: 4)
* 8 bytes (alignment: 1)
* 8 bytes (alignment: 2)
* 8 bytes (alignment: 4)
* 8 bytes (alignment: 8)
* 12 bytes (alignment: 1)
* 12 bytes (alignment: 2)
* 12 bytes (alignment: 4)
* 16 bytes (alignment: 1)
* 16 bytes (alignment: 2)
* 16 bytes (alignment: 4)
* 16 bytes (alignment: 8)
* 16 bytes (alignment: 16)
* 24 bytes (alignment: 1)
* 24 bytes (alignment: 2)
* 24 bytes (alignment: 4)
* 24 bytes (alignment: 8)
* 32 bytes (alignment: 1)
* 32 bytes (alignment: 2)
* 32 bytes (alignment: 4)
* 32 bytes (alignment: 8)
* 32 bytes (alignment: 16)
* 32 bytes (alignment: 32)

That's 28 different size classes. But we might be able to eliminate some of
them. For example, we probably don't need to support a 32-byte value with
1-byte alignment. We could just overalign it (e.g. 8-byte alignment), which
might cause us to waste a little space on padding. But it seems unlikely
that we would ever end up with a 32-byte value (a struct-like type) that
is composed of 32 1-byte fields. If I remove the ones that don't seem useful,
I end up with:

* 1 byte
* 2 bytes (alignment: 1)
* 2 bytes (alignment: 2)
* 4 bytes (alignment: 1)
* 4 bytes (alignment: 2)
* 4 bytes (alignment: 4)
* 8 bytes (alignment: 4)
* 8 bytes (alignment: 8)
* 12 bytes (alignment: 4)
* 16 bytes (alignment: 4)
* 16 bytes (alignment: 8)
* 16 bytes (alignment: 16)
* 24 bytes (alignment: 4)
* 24 bytes (alignment: 8)
* 32 bytes (alignment: 4)
* 32 bytes (alignment: 8)
* 32 bytes (alignment: 16)
* 32 bytes (alignment: 32)

We're down to 18. And 18^2 = 324, so there are 324 possibilties for each
binary type constructor. That's not great, but it's ok. Let's try an
example. Consider a type like this:

    data TwoOfEach a b = TwoOfEach {0: a, 1: a, 2: b, 3: b}

Whichever type argument has a greater alignment requirement gets to come
first. Here are some examples:

    a=(W8,A8), b=(W4,A4)  => 0: 0  | 1: 8  | 2: 16 | 3: 20
    a=(W8,A4), b=(W16,A8) => 0: 32 | 1: 40 | 2: 0  | 3: 16
    a=(W16,A1), b=(W2,A2) => 0: 4  | 1: 20 | 2: 0  | 3: 2

We could try simplifying things further. What about this set instead:

* 1 byte
* 2 bytes (alignment: 2)
* 4 bytes (alignment: 4)
* 8 bytes (alignment: 8)
* 12 bytes (alignment: 4)
* 16 bytes (alignment: 8)
* 16 bytes (alignment: 16)
* 24 bytes (alignment: 8)
* 32 bytes (alignment: 16)
* 32 bytes (alignment: 32)

Now we're down to just 10 variants. What exactly are some of these larger
ones getting used for? Things like:

* Lat-lon pairs (Size: 16, Alignment: 8)
* UUIDs (Size: 16, Alignment: 16)
* IPv6 addresses (Size: 16, Alignment: 16)
* SHA256 hashes (Size: 32, Alignment: 32)

And miscellaneous structures with little bits of information grouped
together (like metadata from an IP frame). In this system, a user
cannot define a struct that would require more than 32 bytes, and
struct type constructors create second-class types (since we cannot
prevent such a struct from requiring a lot of space).

It's possible to go further and support a 64-byte type. One difficulty
with 64-byte quantities is that the alignment requirement can waste
a ton of space. If we do not align them, we end up with loads and stores
that are guaranteed to split cache lines. This is a pretty uncommon case
though, so I should probably stop worrying about it.

Also, note that non-polymorphic fields in a data type can have all kinds
of sizes alignments that polymorphic ones cannot. These are fine because
we do not need to determine their offsets dynamically.
