# Different Refinements for Unsigned Types

What if signed and unsigned types just had completely different refinements?
For unsigned types, we are trying to track exactly what values can appear.
For signed types, we need to track ranges. Or we might want multiple variants
of unsigned types, each with its own different types of refinements. Useful
things to track:

* What values can appear (restricted of ASCII character sets)
* How many bits are set
* Whether or not a particular bit is set

But I think that only the first is really useful. The second one is useful
for certain kinds of compressed arrays (like in HAMTs), but we need dependent
types. The third one is not that much more useful than the first.
