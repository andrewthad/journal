# Rethinking Constructed Types

I ran into this situation recently as I started to add support for mutable
objects:

    { @ListS64 = constructed
      { Cons = 
        { head = S64
        , tail = ^0
        }
      , Nil = {} 
      }
    ; @MutableListS64 = constructed.mutable
      { Cons =                      
        { head = S64
        , tail = @List64
        }
      , Nil = {} 
      }   
    ; ...
    }

We don'really want define the list type twice. We need a way
to refer to the data constructors and their fields and then layer mutability
on top:

    { @ListS64Inside = constructors
      { Cons = 
        { head = S64
        , tail = ^0
        }
      , Nil = {} 
      }
    ; @MutableListS64 = constructed Mutable @ListS64Inside
    ; @ImmutableListS64 = constructed Immutable @ListS64Inside
    ; ...
    }

To make this possible, we have to make changes to the language:

* The kind of `ListS64Inside` is not `Type`. It's `Constructors`. This is new.
  We can lift a component of kind `Constructors` into a `Type` with the
  `constructed` keyword. Even `Type`, however, cannot really be a single
  kind. We must distinguish between mutable types and immutable types.
* The expansion of debruijn-indexed recursive types is different. It is not
  possible to have a field with a mutable type, so both the mutable list
  and the immutable list have an immutable list in their `tail` field.

When we allocate an object, we should refer to the inner type:

    { $myList0 = allocate @ListS64Inside Cons
    ; $myList1 = write $myList0 head 42
    ; $myList2 = write $myList0 tail $someImmutableList
    ; $myList3 = freeze $myList2
    ; ...
    }

Here, the binders myList 0, 1, and 2 have type `constructed Mutable @ListS64Inside`,
and myList3 has type `constructed Immutable @ListS64Inside`.
