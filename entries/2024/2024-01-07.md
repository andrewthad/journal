# Different Intermediate Parser Stages

A variation on an idea from 2024-01-06:

    // Sequenced assignments with terminal non-assignment
    {binder0 = term0; binder1 = term1; result}
    // Concurrent assignments (no terminal)
    {field0 = term0, field1 = term1}
    // Tuples, function arguments (no assignment)
    (..., ...)
    // Arrays (no assignment)
    [..., ...]

What's interesting about this syntax tree is that we can always distinguish
between the first two cases:

* `{}`: concurrent assignment
* `{x = y}`: concurrent assignment
* `{x}`: sequential assignment
