# Generate My Functions, Not My Types

Most codegen tools that work with data interchange formats (json, protobuf,
etc.) generate all of the types for the user. I think this is often a bad deal
for users. Reasons:

* If the language has something like globally unique typeclasses (traits in
  rust), these have to be defined with the data. It's hard to do this when
  you don't get to define the data.
* The types systems of data interchange languages lack some of the nuance
  that the types in general-purpose programming languages have. For example,
  we might want to say that an array of 6 bytes is a MAC address. It might
  be impossible to define this in the data-interchange language. Or, even if
  it is possible to define it, we might want to use an existing type for
  MAC addresses, not a freshly defined type that no existing library works
  with.
* If the user is only deserializing, they might not even want to deserialize
  all of the fields in each object. They might only want the subset that
  they use. This saves both memory and CPU cycles.
