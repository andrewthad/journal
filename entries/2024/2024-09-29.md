# Anticapabilities

The biggest problem with the low-level system in Linear Regions Are
All You Need is that region capabilities oversequentialize programs.
I have an idea that fixes this problem: anticapabilities. The intuitive
definition is:

* Linearity is extended with annotations that correspond to all natural
  numbers. So instead of 1 and many, we have 1, 2, 3, etc. and many.
* We may "fork" a capability. This lets us use it additional times but
  it pollutes the context with anticapabilities that must also be consumed.
* An anticapability is consumed by combining it with a capability.

The definition involving primitives is:

    new   : Unit -> âˆƒ(r : Region). (Handle r, Cap r {1})
    free  : (Handle r, Cap r {1}) -> Unit
    fork  : Cap r {n + 1} -> (Cap r {n + m + 1}, Anticap r {m})
    join  : (Cap r {n + m + 1}, Anticap r {m}) -> Cap {n + 1}
    merge : (Cap r {n}, Cap r {m}) -> Cap r {n + m}

I'm not sure whether or not fork and join need the "plus one" parts of their
consumption annotations. I did this to prevent using them to consume a
capability zero times, but the type system might end up preventing this
anyway. We need a merge operation for merging capabilities back together.
It is sound to merge anticapabilities as well, but I'm not sure whether
or not an operation for that is needed.

Think about:

* The primitives `new` and `free` have sequencing problems because they
  use Unit.
