# Recursive Types, Identity, Lowering to C Structs

(Note: This entry reaches a dead end, but I continue on 2024-06-27.) 

I've been working recently with type systems that involve types
that are defined structurally. Recursively defined types present a special
challenge. Let's focus on two problems:

* How can we tell if two types are equal?
* How can we lower types to C structs?

Let's consider a simple case. Consider two presentations of cons lists:

    { Cons S64 $0 | Nil }
    { Cons S64 { Cons S64 $0 | Nil } | Nil }

These are the same type. An function that compares types for equality needs to
build a stack of object types as it descends into each object:

    equals :: [Type] -> Type -> [Type] -> Type -> Bool

When we compare `{ Cons S64 $0 | Nil }` against `$0`, we look up the entry
in position `$0` in the stack. Let's try something more tricky:

    { Cons S64 { Cons S64 $1 | Nil } | Nil }

This is also the same type. When we compare against `{ Cons S64 $0 | Nil }`,
here's what should happen:

    Step 0 (initial state)
    [{ Cons S64 $0 | Nil }], { Cons S64 $0 | Nil }
    [{ Cons S64 { Cons S64 $1 | Nil } | Nil }], { Cons S64 { Cons S64 $1 | Nil } | Nil }
    Step 1
    [{ Cons S64 $0 | Nil }], $0
    [{ Cons S64 { Cons S64 $1 | Nil } | Nil }], { Cons S64 $1 | Nil }
    Step 2
    [{ Cons S64 $0 | Nil }], { Cons S64 $0 | Nil }
    [{ Cons S64 { Cons S64 $1 | Nil } | Nil }], { Cons S64 $1 | Nil }
    Step 3
    [{ Cons S64 $0 | Nil }], $0
    [{ Cons S64 { Cons S64 $1 | Nil } | Nil }], $1

Wow, I do not understand this as well as I thought I did. I need to come back to this
later.
