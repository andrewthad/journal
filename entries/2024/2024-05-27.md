# Additional Strengths of Monomorphization

Reflecting on the entry from 2024-05-26, I have realized that monomorphization
has even more strengths than I had realized. In particular, with reference
counting, lowerings of polymorphic functions end up with a bunch of code
that check the type to see if a reference count needs to be incremented.
I had been thinking that I could get away with just tracking the size and
using memcpy to copy expressions of compile-type-unknown types around.
And this would probably work if I were using a tracing GC instead of
reference counting. But reference counting moves more of the automatic
memory management code into the code path for the actual program. And
then the handling of polymorphic functions becomes terrible.
