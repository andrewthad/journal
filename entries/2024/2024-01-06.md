# Syntax for Recursive Bindings

What I've done previously for recursive groups is this:

    { alpha = ...
    ; rec
      { foo = ...
      ; bar = ...
      ; baz = ...
      }
    ; beta = ...
    }

I don't like this though because it makes it look like the recursively
bound functions are not available in `beta`.
In the low-level language that does not include polymorphism, we could do
something like this instead:

    { alpha = ...
    ; rec foo = ...
    ; rec bar = ...
    ; rec baz = ...
    ; beta = ...
    }

This puts `foo`, `bar`, and `baz` in a recursive group. Now it's more
syntactically evident that they are available in `beta`, but I wish
that the names were aligned with `alpha` and `beta`. Maybe this:

    { alpha = ...
    ; #rec [foo, bar, baz]
    ; foo = ...
    ; bar = ...
    ; baz = ...
    ; beta = ...
    }

Now the alignment problem is resolved. We could instead try this:

    { alpha = ...
    ; foo rec = ...
    ; bar rec = ...
    ; baz rec = ...
    ; beta = ...
    }

I like this one a little more because it is less noisy in the common case
of having a single binding in a recursive group.

# Intermediate Parser Stages

I've played around with an intermediate parser stage that groups opening
and closing brackets (round, square, and curly). Here are some other
constructs that I've thought about recognizing in an intermediate parser:

    // Sequenced assignments inside curly braces
    {... = ... ; ... = ...}
    // Concurrent assignments inside curly braces
    {... = ... , ... = ...}
    // Tuples, function arguments
    (..., ...)
    // Arrays
    [..., ...]
