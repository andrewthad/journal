# Where Do Refinements Go?

There are two ways to think about where refinements should go:

1. A refinement is paired with a base type (an unrefined type) at the leaves
   of type expressions.
2. A refinement only appears at the very topmost level of a type expression.
   It is effectively "on the binder".

These two strategies have different tradeoffs.

* Strategy 1 makes it easier to use type abstraction with refined types.
* Strategy 2 makes it clear that some refined object types are subtypes of
  others.

The first strategy is preferable because type abstraction is important.
It's extremely useful to be able to talk about an "array of integers
less than 100".
