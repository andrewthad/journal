# Dependent Types and Regions in a Low-Level Language

One problem with regions is dealing with shadowing. With values,
shadowing does not really matter that much. You can just replace the
old value in the context with the new one. But when a region is shadowed,
we cannot just change the types of all values that were allocated in that
region. We could instead represent regions as debruijn indices. This isn't
unreasonable. The names of regions typically don't even mean anything.
The often have names like `r`, `r1`, and `r2`. We could do this with
type variables as well. In fact, with primops, this is already how we
prefer to deal with type variables. Debruijn levels are preferable to
debruijn indices here. That way, the context stays the same when we
introduce a new region.
