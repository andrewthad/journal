# Avoiding Let-Case

There is a pattern that looks like this that I thought was necessary in
low-level IRs:

    let x = case y of
          A -> ... a
          B -> ... b
     in z

However, this can be handled with join points:

    lbl go(c) = z
     in case y of
          A -> ... go(a)
          B -> ... go(b)

So, it's possible to require that `case` always appears in a "terminal"
position, and you don't lose any expressivity.
