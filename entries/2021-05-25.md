# Several Ways to Compress

Just some notes on different ways to compress data. Here, I am concerned
primarily with decompression operations, not compression operations.

* Array Compression, all `VarInt` flavors. Fast single-code-path iteration,
  slow random access, acceleration with SIMD might be possible.
* Array Compression, base offset. Fast iteration, but requires a different
  path for each offset width. Fast single-code-path random access. SIMD
  acceleration trivial (for width of 1, 2, 4, and 8).
* Struct Compression, tiny (64B or 128B) blocks. Accessing any field requires
  decompressing the block it resides in to stack. Effective for pointers and
  for small integers.

I've been thinking about how these might be used when working with a B Tree.
With a B Tree, the leaves have arrays of:

1. Keys (assume 64-bit integers)
2. Pointers to nodes
3. Values in arrays. For integer values, these are integers, and for boxed
   values, these are pointers.
