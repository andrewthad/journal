# More thoughts about Dependent Types with Subtyping

More thoughts about the entry from 2023-06-30. 

If we distinguish between naturals and integers, we can get better subtyping
for inequality predicates. For naturals `a` and `b`, we know that:

    (Int | ? <= a) <: (Int | ? <= a + b)

What about this situation from 2023-06-30:

    x : Int | x >= a
    y : Int | y >= x

Should the type system understand, without any user annotation, that
`y` is GTE `a`. I think not. Instead, we must create a new value
that aliases it:

    y1 = gteTrans x a y
    y1 : (Int | ? >= x, ? >= a)
    y ~ y1

We copy all of the old refinements into the new binder (`y1`), and we
output an equality constraint indicating that `y` and `y1` are equal.

In this system, equality constraints only work on the binder, not on
its refinements. So, for example, if we know that

    x0 : Int | x0 >= 100
    x1 : Int
    x0 ~ x1

We *cannot* use `x1` where a value of type `Int | ? >= 100` is expected,
but we can use `x0`. For this reason, we must copy all the refinements
to the new binder when we invoke `gteTrans`.
