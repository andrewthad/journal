# Syntax for a Language

I've been playing around with ideas for language syntax recently. I jot some
of them down here. First, function declaration with a case-like compare
statement:

    define example (Int, Person) -> Bool
    as (n,p):
      x = p.age
      m = n + 55
      compare x m:
        Lt: True
        Eq: False
        Gt:
          y = m + 17
          p.height < y

What about assigning to the results of a case (or case-like) statement:

    define example (Node,Int) -> Bool
    as (node,n):
      y = case node:
        Branch{b}:
          c = b.mask + n
          ...
        Leaf: n + 1
      y + 16

What about introducing a recursive join point in the RHS of a
let binding:

    define example (Int,Int) -> Bool
    as (x,y):
      z = :
        countdown(acc,n): compare n 0:
          Lt: crash("invariant violated")
          Eq: acc
          Gt: countdown(newAcc, n - 1) 
        countdown(0,x)
      y + z

I don't particularly like having the colon hanging to the
right on its own. Maybe it would be best to require a keyword
before it.
