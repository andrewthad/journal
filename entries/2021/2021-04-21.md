# Second-Order Functional Programming

In a comment in the discussion that followed
[More Points for Lazy Evaluation](https://augustss.blogspot.com/2011/05/more-points-for-lazy-evaluation-in.html),
Lennart Augustsson argues that higher-order functions are difficult to use
in strict languages:

I've been thinking about a hypothetical second-order strict functional
programming language in which these functions would be accepted:

    map  : (a -> b) -> List a -> List b
    fold : (b -> a -> b) -> b -> List a -> List b

But this would be rejected:

    foo : ((Int -> Bool) -> Char) -> Char

The implementation would just specialize `map` and `fold`, inlining the
function argument into any number of possible specializations. I had been
wondering "Does giving up on higher-order functions come at a significant
cost to the developer?" My personal experience says no. I work with Haskell
(a lazy language), and while I occasially use second-order functions, I
never use third-order functions. I find Lennart's argument interesting because
I had not previously considered that, in a strict setting, higher-order
functional might be difficult to use.
