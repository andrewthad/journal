# Flavors of Ordered Collections

In the journal entry yesterday, I explored ways to unified several different
array types. An alternative to all of this is to use module signatures. The
advantage that module signatures have is that we could make several important
distinctions clear:

* Does the collection type support `O(1)` indexing?
* What is the iteration order? The two important ones are front to back and
  back to front.
