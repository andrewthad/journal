# Type Constructors and Representation Polymorphism

Consider a type like `Option`:

    Option : {r : Rep} -> (a : r) -> Type (Sum [NullRep,r])

The result kind depends on the kind of one of the type arguments.
By contrast, a recursive type like list will unconditionally be
boxed:

    List : {r : Rep} -> (a : r) -> Type Boxed

During typechecking, how should we deal with runtime representation
variables that appear in type constructors? Let's assume that we
do not have higher-kinded types. We would like to be able to omit
the `r` variables that can be inferred if possible.

I think that the result kind can only depend on the kind variable arguments
to the type constructor, never on any of the type variables themselves. If
we are able to restrict ourselves to not having any kind metavariables, then
when we go to compare two type constructors, we should just be able to
check that the kind arguments agree, not even doing anything like subtyping,
just a straight "are these two values equal?".
