# Handle Bitvec Logic with Primops

One way to avoid having to deal with `bitvec` logic is to just have primops
for anything that would need that logic. For example, to union compressed
arrays of optional elements:

    union :
         (maskA : Bits64, maskB : Bits64, elemsA : Ptr e, elemsB : Ptr e, maskDst : Bits64, dst : Ptr e) |
           (popcnt maskA = len elemsA, popcnt maskB = len elemsB, popcnt maskDst = len dst, maskA | maskB = maskC)
      -> (newDst : Ptr e) | base(dst) = base(newDst)

This lets us treat functions like `popcnt` and bitwise or as opaque. The
drawback is that this implementation of `union` cannot combine elements.
It must be either right biased or left biased. This is a pretty big problem.
