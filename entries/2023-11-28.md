# LL(k) Parsers

I found the [LL(1) Parser Visualization](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spring20/cos320/LL1/),
which is pretty useful.

I've seen several different formulations of the algorithm for finding a "first set".
For example, here is a confusing description from
[geeksforgeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/first-set-in-syntax-analysis/):

    o 1. If x is a terminal, then FIRST(x) = { ‘x’ }
    o 2. If x-> Є, is a production rule, then add Є to FIRST(x).
    o 3. If X->Y1 Y2 Y3….Yn is a production, 
    o     1. FIRST(X) = FIRST(Y1)
    o     2. If FIRST(Y1) contains Є then FIRST(X) = { FIRST(Y1) – Є } U { FIRST(Y2) }
    o     3. If FIRST (Yi) contains Є for all i = 1 to n, then add Є to FIRST(X).

Here is a better one from
[James Brunskill's blog](https://www.jambe.co.nz/UNI/FirstAndFollowSets):

    o 1. If X is a terminal then First(X) is just X!
    o 2. If there is a Production X → ε then add ε to first(X)
    o 3. If there is a Production X → Y1Y2..Yk then add first(Y1Y2..Yk) to first(X)
    o 4. First(Y1Y2..Yk) is either
    o     1. First(Y1) (if First(Y1) doesn't contain ε)
    o     2. OR (if First(Y1) does contain ε) then First (Y1Y2..Yk) is everything in First(Y1) <except for ε > as well as everything in First(Y2..Yk)
    o     3. If First(Y1) First(Y2)..First(Yk) all contain ε then add ε to First(Y1Y2..Yk) as well.

Both of these formulations have a "if there is a production X -> ε, then
add ε to first(X)", but I'm not sure that it is necessary. I think that it
is implied by the later rules (rule 4.3 in Burnskill's formulation).

Something interesting that the Parser Visualization tool does is tracking
nullability separately rather than lumping ε in with the rest of the terminals.
I like this approach.
