# Proving Properties of Functions

One neat thing that dependently typed (DT) languages let you do is write
proofs separately from functions. For example:

    data Nat = S Nat | Z

    plus : Nat -> Nat -> Nat
    plus (S n) m = S (plus n m)
    plus Z m = m

    assoc : plus a (plus b c) = (plus a b) c
    assoc = ...

In the body of `assoc`, the typechecker automatically simplifies `plus`
whenever the first argument to `plus` is of a known shape. This works well for
simple inductive functions, but how do we use something like this for more
complicated functions. For example:

    findElementIndex : X -> Array X -> Nat -> Option Nat
    findElementIndex e arr arrLen =
      jpt go ix = if ix < arrLen
            then if arr[ix] == e
              then Some ix
              else go (ix + 1)
            else None
       in go 0
    data LiftOption : (a -> Prop) -> Option a -> Type where
      LiftSome : f a -> LiftOption f (Some a)
      LiftNone : LiftOption f None
    bound : LiftOption (_ < arrLen) (findElementIndex e arr arrLen)

How can we write this proof? Our top-level function `findElementIndex`
is not defined inductively, but the recursive join point `go` is. We need
to somehow guide the proof. Let's try:

    bound arrLen e arr =
      findElementIndex e arr arrLen
      ===
      jpt go ix = JPTBODY in go 0
      boundGo : (ix : Nat) -> LiftOption (_ < arrLen) (go ix)
      boundGo
        | ix <? arrLen = // RHS of go reduces because the inequality is known
            | arr[ix] ==? e = LiftSome (ix < arrLen) // we just proved this in the line above
            | otherwise = boundGo (ix + 1)
        | otherwise = LiftNone
      boundGo 0

This glosses over important details, so I'm not really sure if it works.
It is more straightforward if we do not use join points. For example:

    findElementIndex : X -> Array X -> Nat -> Option Nat
    findElementIndex e arr arrLen = go 0 e arr arrLen

    go : Nat -> X -> Array X -> Nat -> Option Nat
    go ix e arr arrLen = if ix < arrLen
      then if arr[ix] == e
        then Some ix
        else go (ix + 1) e arr arrLen
      else None
  
    bound : arrLen -> e -> arr -> LiftOption (_ < arrLen) (findElementIndex e arr arrLen)
    bound arrLen e arr = boundGo 0 arrLen e arr

    boundGo : ix -> arrLen -> e -> arr -> LiftOption (_ < arrLen) (go ix e arr arrLen)
    boundGo ix arrLen e arr
      | ix <? arrLen = // RHS of go reduces because the inequality is known
          | arr[ix] ==? e = LiftSome (ix < arrLen) // we just proved this in the line above
          | otherwise = boundGo (ix + 1)
      | otherwise = LiftNone

I could probably write this in Agda. I probably should to help myself
understand all of this better.

Other thoughts:

* Termination checking: We need to know that `boundGo` terminates. Not terribly
  worried about this for now.
* Separating proofs from code: One of the cool things about DT systems is that
  they allow you to blend proofs with code. I prefer to keep these two separate.
  Every value-level function should have a type that does not involve any proofs.
  At the proof-level, you should be able to write many different refined
  types of the function. The refined types might involve both preconditions
  and postconditions.
* I'm not sure how to deal with recursive join points. These are pretty
  important.
