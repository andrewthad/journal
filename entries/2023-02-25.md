# ANF vs Not ANF

ANF is an restriction applied to lambda calculus and similar systems
that means that applications only accepts atomic values as its arguments.
For example, this is not in ANF:

    let x = f(g(y),h(z))

We can convert this to ANF with:

    let a = g(y)
    let b = h(z)
    let x = f(a,b)

Is there a reason to prefer one to the other? If bindings are sequential,
then ANF makes us lose information about concurrent evaluation that was
present in the first form. But, binding does not have to be sequential,
and it is possible to have a let-like construct with a directed graph
instead.
