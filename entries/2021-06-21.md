# Reference-Counted Segmented Stacks

In a language that supports explicit stack allocation and laziness (thunks),
a thunk may end up referring to memory backed by the stack. One way,
probably not the best way, to resolve this dilema is to make the stack
segmented. Not the ordinary sense of the phrase "segmented stack" though.
Instead, there would be one segment per function call. The segments would
each be reference counted. A thunk would include a reference to its stack
segment. This gives us two useful behaviors:

1. Thunks can refer to stack-allocated objects.
2. Thunks generate stack traces when they fail. The stack trace refers to
   the site at which the thunk was created, not the site at which it was
   forced.

Additionally, these segmented stacks, just like all implementations of
segmented stacks, would waste less memory than fixed-size stacks.

The penalty of such stacks is that all function calls would become
more expensive. Also, a single thunk could potentially hold a large
number of stack segments live. If it wasn't referring to a stack-allocated
object, this would waste memory for no real benefit other than a good stack
trace in the event of an exception.

It is possible to mitigate some of the allocation penalties by providing
a special stack area for leaf functions that do not allocate thunks.
