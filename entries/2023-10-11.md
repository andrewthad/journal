# Monorepresentation and Specialization

Continuing thoughts from 2023-10-10, new idea is:

* Have two kinds of width variables: static and dynamic. Static width variables
  imply that there will be a specialized copy of the function for each width.
  A static width variable can be upcasted to a dynamic width variable. That is,
  static width is a subtype of dynamic width.
* Introduce a special construct for width-based delegation that tail calls into
  specializations. Neither the arguments nor the result of such a function can
  be width polymorphic. This is the only way to turn a dynamic width variable
  into a static one.

For example:

    sumAs64 : (w : StaticWidth) -> Array (Integer Signed w) -> Integer Signed 64
    sumAs64 w arr =
      go(acc,ix) = if ix < arr.length
        then go(upcast(index(w,Integer Signed w,arr,index),S64), ix + 1)
        else acc
      go(0 :: S64, 0 :: S64)
    sumAs64Dyn : (w : DynamicWidth) -> Array (Integer Signed w) -> Integer Signed 64
    sumAs64Dyn w = $delegate(sumAs64,w)

That's it. That's the whole thing.
