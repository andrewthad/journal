# General Thoughts

* For a nursery that supports interior pointers, require power-of-two alignment
  on all the objects and store the layout bitmasks separately. Now when you are
  trying to figure out what a pointer is to, you find where it points to in the
  layout table and look at the bytes around it.
* An efficient implementation of an ordered map with string keys is tricky.
  Tries have a nasty degenerate case where you might have to walk `n` nodes,
  where `n` is the length of a key. One big problem with this is that trie
  insertion typically uses the stack, but a large `n` might blow the stack.
  I'm now thinking that the least footgunny ordered map is going to be
  something like a B Tree, but it does some form of key compression. When
  a node splits, you learn from your parent how many bytes (a base-2 number)
  you need to pass upword. Sometimes though, you would need to decide to
  make a node use more bytes. You could accomplish this by moving to the
  right and then going all the way down to a leftmost child to find a full
  key. (Full keys should always be stored in leaf nodes.) This is only a
  half-baked idea, but maybe I'll turn back to it one day.
