# The Operating System Should Provide TLS

It is widely accepted that an operating system should provide TCP. Whether or
not the TCP stack lives in the kernel is another question. Unfortunately, TLS
isn't typically exposed in the same way. On Linux, application authors typically
link against openssl, which means they perform the TLS handshake as part of
the running process. Consequences of this include:

* Every application has to decide how to deal with expired or self-signed
  certificates.
* Applications have to figure out where to look for CA certs so that they
  can decide whether or not to trust a server certificate.
* As the root user, there is no easy way to view the unencrypted traffic
  is being sent or received. For a non-TLS-encrypted session, it is possible
  to use `tcpdump` and other tools to inspect the traffic. But for a
  TLS-encrypted session, these just show you the encrypted payload, which
  is useless.
