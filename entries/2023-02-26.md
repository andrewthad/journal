# Proof Term and ANF

## Incompatibility of Term-Level Optimization and Proofs

ANF makes some kinds of proofs easier to deal with. Consider:

    add0 : (a : Int, b : Int) -> (c : Int, !c = add1 !a !b)

Above, bang lifts bound identifiers from the term level to the proposition
level. What if it was not restricted to bound identifiers though. Consider:

    let z = add0(f(x,x),g(y)) 
    -- z : Int, !z = add1(!f(x,x),!g(y))

Suppose that a term-level optimization pass knows that when the first and
second argument to `f` are the same, the result is zero. Lets apply the
optimization:

    let z = add0(0,g(y)) 
    -- z : Int, !z = add1(0,!g(y)) // reduces to !z = !g(y)

But now we have lost something! What if something downstream was counting
on the proof that was originally in scope? It's not there anymore, and
the program would fail to typecheck after optimization. For this reason,
I believe that this system is a bad idea.

## Introducing Explicit Proofs

It is possible to fix this. Suppose that any such rewrite must be accompanied
by a proof that the original term and the new term are equal. This would
mean that the new expression would be:

    with annihilationOfF(x) // brings into scope !f(x,x) = 0
    let z = add0(0,g(y)) 
    -- z : Int, !z = add1(0,!g(y))

And now the resulting program will certainly typecheck.
