# Functions inside indefinite modules

I wrote about this some on 2023-08-01, but I didn't describe this particular
difficulty. There is a weird interaction between functions and indefinite
modules that causes function references (when calling a function) to track
the function's "distance" from the call site (in a debruijn style).
Consider this scenario:

    module X (sig a):
      function foo() // body refers to something in sig a
      module Y (sig b):
        function bar() // body refers to something in sigs a and b
        module Z:
          function baz():
            ...
            foo() // i.e. ../../foo()
            bar() // i.e. ../bar()
            a.car()
            b.con()
            ...

Inside `baz`, we call both `foo` and `bar`. It's possible to instantiate Y
further down in X. And it's also possible to instantiate X without
instantiating Y. Let's say we instantiate Y (passing in B for b):

    module X (sig a):
      function foo() // body refers to something in sig a
      module Y(sig b) // as before
      module YB:
        function bar()
        module Z:
          function baz():
            ...
            foo() // i.e. ../../foo()
            bar() // i.e. ../bar()
            a.car()
            B.con()
            ...

Everything stayed mostly the same, which I did not expect. If we instantiate
X instead:

    module XA:
      function foo()
      module Y (sig b):
        function bar()
        module Z:
          function baz():
            ...
            foo() // i.e. ../../foo()
            bar() // i.e. ../bar()
            A.car()
            b.con()
            ...

So that basically works out the same way as well. Tracking distance upward
might still be useful inside a compiler since it makes your dependencies
a lot more clear. For example, in `XA`, we could hoist `foo` up a level,
but when we do that, we have to modify all the references to it to indicate
that it's now at a different level. Shadowing becomes a problem here.
Consider:

    module R:
      function act()
      module S:
        function act()
        function play() // refers to act

If we hoist the `act` inside `S` up to `R`, then we no longer have any way
to disambiguate. The simple solution is to just rename it (probably with
the module as the prefix) when doing this.

Maybe there is no purpose in tracking levels. We have to do some kind of
pass where we assign unique names to things anyway. When elaborating module
application, we could use a cryptographically secure hash algorithm to
rename everything. That way, if we ever performed the same instantiation
twice, the resulting module would end up with the same id. That's important
for correctness during typechecking, and it's important for reuse during
evaluation.
