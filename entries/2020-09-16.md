# Inequality as a Poset

Can the combination of inquality, addition, and multiplication on naturals
be seen as a poset? Let's consider some examples:

* `>= a + b ==> >= a`
* `<= a ==> <= a + b`
* `<= a && <= b ==> < a * b`
* `>= a * b ==> >= a || >= b` (Not very useful because it needs disjunction)

This is not getting anywhere.
