# Computing Field Positions, Continued

Continuing from 2024-08-13.

I have thought of a shortcut that I can take. I want to take advantage
of these properties: Most polymorphic types only have a single type
argument, and a few have two type arguments. Similarly, most data
constructors do not have a variable-length array.

Let's define a "strategy" for each field. The strategy tells us how
to get from the base object address to the address of the field.
Here are some possible strategies:

* Constant: The field is located at a fixed position. This might be
  the case for `Cons` depending on what kind of alignment rules we have.
* Lookup: Put a type argument (a size) into a lookup table to find the
  position of the field. Each field has its own lookup table, so these
  are not cache friendly.

The constant strategy might not be useful if we are serious about aligning
16-byte and 32-byte values. So we might only want the lookup strategy, and
if we do that for all the fields, we should put them all together. That is,
the strategy should be for the entire object, not just for a field.

VLAs are a serious problem. Maybe just give up on these. These are more useful
in languages that prioritize immutability, and I've been slowly moving away
from that.
