# Almost Pure Functions

## Background

GHC offers at least features that exploit it's aggresive tracking of side
effects:

* `ST` and `runST` for local mutation
* `atomicModifyIORef` for pure atomic updates to an `IORef`
* `STM` for atomic interactions with many references

However, there are effects that are not pure but could in theory still be
used with one or more of these.

## Randomness
