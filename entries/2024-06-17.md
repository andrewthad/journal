# Notes On LL(1) Parse Tables

I always get tripped up on how to make parse tables. There are a lot of
incorrect or incomplete explanations online. These are some notes to remind
me what everything means and how it fits together.

## Definitions

Here are the important terms:

* Terminal: Basically just a token
* Nonterminal: An identifier for a "parser" that accepts zero or more tokens.
  This does not include a "body". It's just the symbol itself.
* Production Rule: Maps a nonterminal to a sequence of nonterminals and
  terminals. Or maps a nonterminal to epsilon. This is a single rule, and
  it does not have alternation. Alternation is supported by creating
  multiple productions rules for the same nonterminal.

## First Function

When we analyze a grammar, we need several functions. One of these is named
`first`, and it returns the "first set" of a sequence of terminals and
nonterminals. Some literature describes `first` as though it were a function
of type `Nonterminal -> Set TerminalOrEpsilon`, but this is not quite right.
We do build a table that looks like that to help us, but the real function
has type `TerminalOrNonterminal -> Set TerminalOrEpsilon`. We have to build
tables to help us define the first function. We use dynamic programming
and wait until we hit a fixed point. The tables can look like:

    firstTable : Map Nonterminal (Set TerminalOrEpsilon)

Or like:

    nullableTable : Map Nonterminal Bool
    firstNonEmptyTable : Map Nonterminal (Set Terminal)
