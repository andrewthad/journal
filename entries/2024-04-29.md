But I realized over the weekend that there is actually a natural way to
accomplish this:

    withMArray :: Int -> (MArray a -o Result One One Unit (MArray a)) -o Result Many Many Unit (Array a)
    throw      :: MArray -o Result One One Unit (MArray a)

We cannot just abandon the `MArray` that we are constructing in the middle
of construction, but we can use an explicit `throw` function. This `throw`
function must be a builtin. And it might be better to use an opaque `Discard`
types instead of `Unit`.

# Linear Consumption of ADTs

The Linear Haskell paper has a simple rule for linear consumption of ADTs:
Scrutinize the value and then consume all linear components once. But this
makes the meaning of linear consumption strange for types that do not have
linear components. This includes `Unit`, `Int`, and `List Int`. The LH paper
makes linear consumption of these trivial. But to get the properties that
I am looking for, it would be preferable if linear consumption of these
was impossible.
