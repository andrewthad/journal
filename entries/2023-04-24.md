# URI Schemes with Transport

IANA maintains a [list of URI schemes](https://www.iana.org/assignments/uri-schemes/uri-schemes.xhtml).
There is a pattern that shows up in several places that I like to call
"application plus transport". The word transport is used in a more general
sense. It's not just OSI Layer 4 transport. Here are some examples,
both standard and nonstandard:

* coaps+tcp (IANA standard)
* coaps+ws (IANA standard)
* stratum+tcp
* stratum+udp
* svn+ssh

I've not found anything that uses `tls` as a transport suffix. Instead, the
letter s shows up as a suffix. For example: http and https, sip and sips,
news and snews. Here are a few schemes that I have invented while working
on applications:

* elasticsearch (implies http and tcp)
* elasticsearch+tls (implies tls, http, and tcp)
* kafka (implies multiple tcp connections)
* prometheus (implies http and tcp)

This kind of thing ought to be more common than it is. For a web browser,
HTTP can be understood as the application layer. But for an API, it is better
understood as a transport layer.
