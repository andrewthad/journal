# Tracking Interior Pointers in a Nursery

What if, to figure out if a nursery object is interior, you keep
a separate smaller area that tells you whether or not each byte pointer
(or maybe just each 64-bit-word pointer) is a base pointer or not.
This suffers from a problem when two objects with interior pointers
are next to each other. It also is inefficient when dealing with
variable-length arrays since it requires call to `memset` for them.

Still, I am hopeful that some variant of this idea will pan out.
