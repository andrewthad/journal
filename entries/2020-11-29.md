# Multiple Mutable Objects

In the journal entry on 2020-11-24, I contemplated pairing nonlinear
mutable data with linear tokens to create linear data. I thought about
fork and join primitives as well. However, these primitives would
cause the formulation of `run` in the entry on 2020-11-27 to become
unsound. How could multiple mutable objects be supported? For example,
consider a function that takes two mutable map arguments:

    foo : <Map* Int Bool, Map* Int Int, X>
       -> <Map* Int Bool, Map* Int Int, Y>

This cannot be allowed since it implies multiple state tokens. I think
that there is a simple solution though. The mutable maps and the token
could be gathered together in a record:

    type Argument* =
      { bools : MutableMap Int Bool
      , ints  : MutableMap Int Int
      , token : Token*
      }

Now, `foo` may be written as:

    foo : <Argument*, X> -> <Argument, Y>

There is a problem though. We need a way to lift map-updating operations
over `Argument`.
