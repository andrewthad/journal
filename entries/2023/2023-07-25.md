# Combined Type System, Again

This continues the thoughts from 2023-07-23. 

    Application =
      TypeConstructor // constructor
      [ImmutableType] // arguments, all immutable types
      Refinements
      Allocation
    Type =
      | Mutable MutableType
      | Immutable ImmutableType
    MutableType = Concrete Application
    ImmutableType =
      | Concrete Application
      | Variable TypeVariable
    Heap = Global | Region RegionVar
    Allocation = Heap Heap | Stack

One tricky thing here is the checking of the refinements. In particular,
do the same refinements apply to mutable and immutable variants of
the same type? I think the answer is yes, but mutable types have
even a few more refinements available, things like "has this field
been initialized", which don't make sense for immutable types.
