# Subtyping with Numeric Inequalities and Negative Constants

This resolves a problem that I had noticed in the system proposed
on 2023-04-04. I really do not want to have negative numbers or subtraction
in this system because natural variables cannot be instantiated with
anything negative. However, the `index` function needs a negative constant.
Here is the type I proposed on 2023-04-04:

    index :
         {n : Nat}
      -> (Nat | ? >= 0 and ? <= n - 1)
      -> (Array a | ?.len = n)
      -> a

A different way to accomplish this is to allow the question mark (self)
identifier to appear mixed with arbitrary terms, rather than requiring it
to stand alone:

    index :
         {n : Nat}
      -> (Nat | ? >= 0 and ? + 1 <= n)
      -> (Array a | ?.len = n)
      -> a

There are a few restrictions. The self identifier cannot have a coefficient,
and it cannot appear on both sides of an inequality. I don't consider either
of these serious. We should even be able to use natural variables on both
sides of the inequality:

    Nat | ? + a + b <= c + d

This ought to be fine. We have these subtyping relationships:
    
    (Nat | ? + a + b <= c) <: (Nat | ? + a + b <= c + d)
    (Nat | ? + a + b <= c + d) <: (Nat | ? + a <= c + d)
    (Nat | ? + a + b <= c + d) <: (Nat | ? <= c + d)

These are all easy to check. I like this system.
