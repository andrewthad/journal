# Even More Simple Borrowing

I'm trying to get this to be even more simple. Here are some additional
restrictions that I've thought about:

1. Only allow taking slices of non-borrowed arrays
2. Require pointer provenance for operations on pointers

The second one is onerous because it requires dependent types (here I'm
only supporting interior pointers into Array, not into other types):

    -- Subtyping: Nonborrowed can be cast to borrowed
    data Borrowedness = Borrowed | Nonborrowed
    slice : Array Nonborrowed a -> Int -> Int -> Array Nonborrowed a
    dereference :
      (a : Type) ->
      (p : Ptr a) ->
      (b : Array Borrowed a) ->
      (p ==. offset(expose(b),n)) ->
      (n >= 0) ->
      (sizeof(b) > n) ->
      a

Or something like that. But we need it. Now, let's see what happens when
we borrow:

    -- context (x0 : Array* T), (sz : (sizeof(x0) = 100)), something : T
    let x1 = borrow(x0)
    // x1 has type Array Borrowed T
    let (p,eq) = borrow(x1)
    // p has type Ptr T
    // eq has type (p ==. offset(expose(x0)
    let i = dereference _ (p + 55) x1 (55 >= 0) (? sz)
    let j = dereference _ (p + 42) x1 (42 >= 0) (? sz)
    let k = dereference _ (p + 30) x1 (30 >= 0) (? sz)
    let x2 = write x0 13 something
    // Here, it is no longer possible to dereference p since x1 cannot
    // be used.

Or, more simply, we can write:

    -- context (x0 : Array* T), (sz : (sizeof(x0) = 100)), something : T
    let x1 = borrow(x0)
    // x1 has type Array Borrowed T
    let i = index x1 55
    let j = index x1 42
    let k = index x1 30
    let x2 = write x0 13 something
    // Here, it is no longer possible to use x1

I'm not sure that this works. Let's see what happens when we try to
type `copyRange`:

    copyRange :
      (src : Array Borrowed a) ->
      (dst : Array* a) ->
      Array* a

Nevermind, this works fine. We can safely copy from any array, either borrowed
or nonborrowed, and know that the two arguments do not alias. So, how are we
able to get away from Futhark's alias analysis? I think the trick is:

1. Do not allow slicing on borrowed arrays
2. Do not allow even trivial aliasing of borrowed arrays. For example,
   we should not accept constructs like `let x3 = x1`. If a borrowed
   array can *only be read from*, then we can avoid any kind of
   alias tracking.

Is this an acceptable compromise? I'm not sure. Not doing alias tracking means
that we cannot write programs like this:

    let v = index (if myBool then x1 else y1) 42

In this particular case, it's not difficult to rewrite the program, but in
other cases, this could be a problem. I can't think of anything at the
moment where this would be a serious issue though.
