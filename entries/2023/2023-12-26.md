# Deviations from POSIX

This is a list of POSIX deviations that I think are useful in a high-level
language:

* Don't use SIGPIPE. Turn it off with `SIG_IGN` and `SO_SIGNOPIPE`.
* Don't bother with character encodings that are configured by
  environment variables. Unconditionally use UTF-8 for writing
  things to stderr.
