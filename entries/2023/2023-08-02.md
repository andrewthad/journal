# Conclusions from Yesterday

I just wanted to reduce the stream of conciousness from 2023-08-01 down
to something platable. Here are the takeaways:

1. Modules need to respect the order in which they are declared. Modules
   that are beside one another cannot all come into scope simultaneously.
   Later modules can see earlier ones, but earlier ones cannot see later
   ones. I'm not sure what to do about functions. It needs to be possible
   to define mutually recursive functions. We could allow functions and
   modules to be interleaved and respect their order, but then functions
   could additionally disregard their order and reference any functions
   that are beside themselves.
2. It should be possible to perform substitution at the application site
   of an indefinite module. If we do this, all indefinite modules should
   disappear, and then we can run the program.
3. I don't think effects are that difficult to handle with an interpreter.
   I don't having a `Let` that sequences effectful operations, and I
   think a dedicated `Bind` is a better choice here.
