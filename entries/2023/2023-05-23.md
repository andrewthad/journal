# Staging and Dependent Types 

Consider a staged program like this:

    raiseToPowerOf : Int1 -> Lift (Int -> Int)
    raiseToPowerOf 0 = quote (\_ -> 1)
    raiseToPowerOf n = quote (\x -> x * splice (raiseToPowerOf (n - 1)) x)

Expanding the specialization that raises a number to the power of 3, we have:

    raiseToPowerOf 3
    ===
    \x -> x * (\y -> y * (\z -> z * (\_ -> 1) z) y) x
    ===
    \x -> x * x * x * 1

What if we wanted to try to prove something like this:

    expPos : n -> i -> (n >= 0) -> (i >= 1) -> (splice (raiseToPowerOf n) i >= 1)

Can we do it?

    multPos : {a} -> {b} -> (a >= 1) -> (b >= 1) -> (a * b >= 1)
    expPos : n -> i -> (n >= 0) -> (i >= 1) -> (splice (raiseToPowerOf n) i >= 1)
    expPos 0 i nprf iprf = trivial
    expPos n i nprf iprf = multPos {} {} iprf (expPos (n - 1) i (predGte nprf) iprf)

I think this should work fine. The trick is basically that we write proofs
about the spliced expression, not about the lifted one.
