# Module System: Debruijn vs Names

In a module system, is there any value in using debruijn indices instead
of names? I don't think so. One place where debrujin beats names is when
we substitute:

    ((lam x. ((lam x. x + x) 5)) 6)

When we apply the outermost lambda and substitue 6 for `x`, it's easy to
accidentally do the wrong thing. The question is whether or not we have to
perform substitution like this when we work with modules. When lowering
modules based with the system that I described on 2023-11-13, I don't
think this poses a problem. I still need to think through this better.
