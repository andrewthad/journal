# Additional High-Level Constructs

Other things that I can think of that it might make sense to layer on top of
a language with permissive functors:

* A phantom `Nat` kind that gets erased at some point. Used for length-indexed
  arrays.
* Higher-order functions. Applying HOFs to closures that close over locally
  bound identifiers.
* Typeclasses. This is hard to do with types that are defined structurally,
  but one option is to just take what we can get. There is a trivial
  derivation of equality for all of them. Even for typeclasses that don't
  have trivial derivations for products and sums, there is often still
  an easy canonical choice for integral types.
* An effects system. This one is pretty important.
