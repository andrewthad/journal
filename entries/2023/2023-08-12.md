# Library That Just Pairs Brackets

The resulting AST looks like this:

    data BracketType
      = Paren
      | Square
      | Curly
    data Syntax t
      = Bracketed BracketType (Array (Syntax t))
      | Token t
      | Literal Text -- a string literal (double quotes)

String literals need special recognition since they may
contain bracket-like characters. Here is an example of
a parse:

    foo(x,y) { return ( x+y ); }
    ==>
    [ Token "foo"
    , Bracketed Paren
      [ Token "x,y"
      ]
    , Bracketed Curly
      [ Token "return"
      , Bracketed Paren
        [ Token "x+y"
        ]
      , Token ";"
      ]
    ]

Two things to notice:

1. Space characters are not tracked at all
2. There is no special support for parsing numbers.
3. Symbols do not break up identifiers.

The work of breaking symbols up is left for a second pass.
We could do that with something like this:

    explodeTokens :: (t -> Array t) -> Syntax t -> Syntax t

Then we could end up with what we want:

    [ Token "foo"
    , Bracketed Paren
      [ Token "x"
      , Token ","
      , Token "y"
      ]
    , Bracketed Curly
      [ Token "return"
      , Bracketed Paren
        [ Token "x"
        , Token "+"
        , Token "y"
        ]
      , Token ";"
      ]
    ]

And then we might map this to some other token type:

    data Token
      = Identifier Text
      | Semicolon
      | Plus
      | Comma
    mapParser ::
         (Array (Syntax t1) -> Maybe (Array (Syntax t2)))
      -> Syntax t1
      -> Maybe (Syntax t2)

Wait, that doesn't work. Rethink this.
