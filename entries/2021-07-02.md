# Typed APIs with Refinements of Natural Numbers

Where do natural numbers actually show up in APIs? The places I am aware
of are:

* Array size
    - Used for SoA, makes safe `zip` possible
    - Used for fixed-length arrays
* Arrays containing indices into other arrays
* Matrices
* Little numbers (e.g. severity between 0 and 10)

On a very minimal level, what is needed to make this work well? We want
to have a safe indexing function:

    index : (Array a | sz = n) -> (Nat | self < n) -> a

However, there are other functions where a natural number itself gets
pull into the type of some result. Consider `replicate`:

    replicate: (Nat | self = n) -> a -> (Array a | sz = n)

The `index` function is entirely unusable if the array is not refined.
This is ok. You should not be able to index into an array if you do
not know anything about its length. But `replicate` is a different
story. We want to be able to `replicate` with an unknown `Nat`, but
the type signature does not let us do that. We could just have
two different `replicate` functions. We need a way to "open up"
an unrefined type, and at that point, we're back to existential
quantification.
