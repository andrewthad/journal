# X86-64 Partial Registers

Most modern X86-64 processors handle writes to small registers by just merging
the result in with the unchanged bits. For operations like `mov`, this can
create false dependencies. For example,

    mov r9b, r10b

If the user doesn't actually what the upper 56 bits in the register are, it is
better to zero them:

    movzx r9, r10b

This `movzx` instruction does not have a dependency on `r9`, but the previous
`mov` instruction did.
