# ANF Compiler Stage

This is related to the entry from 2022-03-18. I think that an ANF stage in
the toy project I've been working on is inevitable. I had hoped that I could
avoid it by targeting C, but even when targeting C, there are places where
this transformation is needed. For example, when lowering a looping construct
or a join point, the arguments need to be evaluated and assigned to a variable.

Unfortunately, GHC's backpack does not work well for sharing an ANF
representation and a non-ANF representation. What we want to be able to do
would look like this in pseudo-SML:

    data Atom
      = Var VarId
      | Int Int64
    sig X
      type Arg
    module Y (X x)
      data Term
        = Atomic Atom
        | Let VarId Term Term
        | App FuncId (Array x.Arg)
    module AtomArg
      type Arg = Atom
    module Anf = Y(AtomArg)
    // These last two are defined recursively
    module TermArg
      type Arg = NonAnf.Term
    module NonAnf = Y(TermArg)

It's the recursive bit that backpack cannot handle. Oh well. I guess
duplication is always an option.

# Proofs when lowering loops to join points

Let's say that we are adding all the numbers in an array, and we have
bounds on the size of the array and on the elements in the array:

    // xs.length <= 1000, xs.allElements{>= 0, <=500}
    for(x in xs)(sum):
      continue(x)

This is a made-up construct for monoidal output. A person intuits that
the result is bounded by zero on the low end and 5e5 on the high end.
A compiler could see this as well. Can this information be preserved
when lowering to a join point. Let's try:

    step
      (ix : Int, acc : Int) | acc >= 0, acc <= ix * 500
      (out : Int) | out >= 0, out <= len * 500
    as(ix,acc):
      case [cmp] ix len:
        GT => impossible
        EQ => acc
        LT => :
          -- Checks constraint ix < len.
          -- Sythesizes constraints {e >= 0, e <= 500}
          e = xs[ix]
          -- For newAcc, we know that {newAcc >= 0, newAcc <= ix * 500 + e}
          newAcc = acc + e
          -- Checks constraint {newAcc >= 0}, trivially holds
          -- Checks constraint {newAcc <= (ix + 1) * 500}
          -- This actually works out fine because solvers allow multiplication
          -- by a constant, so this becomes:
          -- Checks constraint {newAcc <= ix * 500 + 500}
          -- And a solver can prove that.
          jump step(ix + 1, newAcc)

This worked out because we got lucky. Let's try again with a non-constant
bound:

    step
      (ix : Int, acc : Int) | acc >= 0, acc <= ix * bound
      (out : Int) | out >= 0, out <= len * bound
    as(ix,acc):
      case [cmp] ix len:
        GT => impossible
        EQ => acc
        LT => :
          -- Checks constraint ix < len.
          -- Sythesizes constraints {e >= 0, e <= bound}
          e = xs[ix]
          -- For newAcc, we know that {newAcc >= 0, newAcc <= ix * bound + e}
          newAcc = acc + e
          -- Checks constraint {newAcc >= 0}, trivially holds
          -- Checks constraint {newAcc <= (ix + 1) * bound}
          -- Distribute:
          -- Checks constraint {newAcc <= (ix * bound) + bound}
          -- And a solver can prove that.
          jump step(ix + 1, newAcc)
    jump step (0,0)

Well that worked out nicely as well. It semes like we can just treat
multiplication as an uninterpreted function except that we must distribute
it when possible. By doing this, we get everything into position for
the inductive step. This works nicely for loops where we must establish
the upper bound bit by bit.

This same technique should work on a vectorized implementation as well.
Everything would just be scaled down by 2, 4, 8, 16, etc., and then
they would be added together in the end. Dealing with masks might be
difficult though. I'm not sure. Let's try:

    step
      (ix : Int, acc : IntX4) | acc >= 0, acc.[0,1,2,3] <= (div ix 4) * bound, ix divides 4 evenly
      (out : Int) | out >= 0, out <= len * bound
    as(ix,acc):
      ixs = <ix+0,ix+1,ix+2,ix+3>
      mask = lt4(ixs, <len,len,len,len>)
      e = maskedIndex4(xs,ixs,mask)
      -- For e, we know that:
      -- {e.0 >= 0, e.0 <= if (ix+0 < len) then bound else 0}
      -- {e.1 >= 0, e.1 <= if (ix+1 < len) then bound else 0}
      -- {e.2 >= 0, e.2 <= if (ix+2 < len) then bound else 0}
      -- {e.3 >= 0, e.3 <= if (ix+3 < len) then bound else 0}
      newAcc = vecAdd4(acc,e)
      -- For newAcc, we know that:
      -- {newAcc.0 >= 0, newAcc.0 <= (div ix 4) * bound + e.0}
      -- {newAcc.1 >= 0, newAcc.1 <= (div ix 4) * bound + e.1}
      -- {newAcc.2 >= 0, newAcc.2 <= (div ix 4) * bound + e.2}
      -- {newAcc.3 >= 0, newAcc.3 <= (div ix 4) * bound + e.3}
      -- Checks constraint {newAcc.N >= 0}, trivially holds
      -- Checks constraint {newAcc.N <= (div (ix + 4) 4) * bound}
      -- This is a bit tricky.
      jump step(ix + 4, newAcc)
    jump step (0,<0,0,0,0>)

There are two small issues, neither of which is insurmountable. The first issue
is that we cannot distribute multiplication anymore because division is in
the way. We could fix this by operating with the scaled down index instead. This
misses out on an opportunity for strength reduction, but that might not actually
matter too much in this case. We probably want to be moving an interior pointer
through the array anyway. If we did that, the index becomes irrelevant (only
needed by the proof). The second issue here is that this loop does not terminate.
I left out the check to see if we have reached the end. Let's try this again:

    // Note: This time, ix is scaled down by 4.
    step
      (ix : Int, len : Int, arr : Array Int, acc : IntX4) | acc >= 0, acc.[0,1,2,3] <= ix * bound, arr.length == len, arr.allElements{>= 0, <=bound}, total = ix * 4 + len
      (out : Int) | out >= 0, out <= total * bound
    as(ix,len,arr,acc):
      ixs = <0,1,2,3>
      mask = lt4(ixs, <len,len,len,len>)
      e = maskedHead4(arr,mask)
      -- For e, we know that:
      -- {e.0 >= 0, e.0 <= if (ix+0 < len) then bound else 0}
      -- {e.1 >= 0, e.1 <= if (ix+1 < len) then bound else 0}
      -- {e.2 >= 0, e.2 <= if (ix+2 < len) then bound else 0}
      -- {e.3 >= 0, e.3 <= if (ix+3 < len) then bound else 0}
      newAcc = vecAdd4(acc,e)
      -- For newAcc, we know that:
      -- {newAcc.0 >= 0, newAcc.0 <= ix * bound + e.0}
      -- {newAcc.1 >= 0, newAcc.1 <= ix * bound + e.1}
      -- {newAcc.2 >= 0, newAcc.2 <= ix * bound + e.2}
      -- {newAcc.3 >= 0, newAcc.3 <= ix * bound + e.3}
      -- Checks constraint {newAcc.N >= 0}, trivially holds
      -- Checks constraint {newAcc.N <= (ix + 1) * bound}, distributes {newAcc.N <= (ix * bound) + bound}
      if all4(mask):
        True => jump step(ix + 1, len - 4, advance(arr,4), newAcc)
        False => horizontalSum4(newAcc)
    jump step (0,len0,arr0,<0,0,0,0>)

I believe this would work correctly.
