# Multi With Expression

This builds on the idea from 2022-03-29. I think that collapsing the
`withX` expressions (`withField` and `withArray`) into a single expression
type would be good. In particular, this makes it easy to map over an array
and produce a new array. The expression would look something like this:

    res = with(dstArr -> dst, srcArrA -> srcA, srcArrB -> srcB):
      ...
      myPtrX = myPtrY - len // move backwards to the beginning
      toArray myPtrX

This construct could also be used in a tail position, but this would not
be lowered to instructions with better performance characteristics. This
contrasts with `case` expressions.
