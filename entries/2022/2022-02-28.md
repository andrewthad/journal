# A Better MIB Browser

Sometimes, people design formats to be human readable, and the result is
just not very human readable. HTML is the example that everyone is familiar
with. MIB files are even worse.

There are a number of websites for browsing MIBs. These are good, but
I want a better one. I don't think that it should be that difficult to
build. It needs to load quickly though. I think that an HTML presentation
of a MIB can be prerendered, and consequently, cached. Important features:

* A search for an OID should return its description, its parent chain (all the
  way to the root), its siblings, and its children. If possible, all of them.
  Some OIDs have 1000 children. That's fine. I want to see them all.
* I'd like to be able to see a deeper view than just children. Maybe drop down
  into grandchild nodes, great grandchild, etc. as long as it doesn't cause
  a million nodes to show up in the page (and freeze the user's browser). This
  is doable with a simple heuristic. The drawback is that pages would not show
  consistent information across different OIDs. The advantage is that a user
  would have an easier time finding what they are looking for.
