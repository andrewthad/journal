# Using Musl in a PL Runtime

I have thought about this before on 2024-11-05.md. The idea is to use
musl but without using all of the standard names for everything. In the
earlier entry, I had figured out how to use `objcopy` to prefix all of
musl's symbols. Since then, I have realized that I probably want to get
rid of some posix features entirely, so it might make since to modify
the source code instead. This is not difficult. For example, to rename
`read`, I just have to change its name in `include/unistd.h` and in
`src/unistd/read.c`.

The main thing that I want to get rid of is thread cancellation. This
feature is almost impossible to use correctly. Musl is very careful
to set cancellation states in its implementations of functions that
touch the file system or the network, but I want to replace all of
the canellation-state changes with no-ops. I think it should be possible
to do this by replacing the implementations with macros.
