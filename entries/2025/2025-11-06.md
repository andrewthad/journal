# Allocation Regions Not Inferred

Suppose we have a function like this:

    myfunc : (Foo@r, Bar@s, Baz@t) -> Bang@u +{Alloc(z)}

All of the regions can be inferred except for `z`. A convenient calling
convention for this might be:

    myfunc(foo, bar, baz)@r

Where the `@r` is used to refer to the region that we are allocating into.

# Second-Class Types to Avoid Region Type Variables

I had considered this idea before and ultimately rejected it. The plan was
to do this:

    index : (Array(a){2}, S32) -> a

Instead of this:

    index : (Array(a)@r, S32) -> a

This cuts down on the number of type variables. The problem I noticed was
that it's not clear what should happen when a field is projected from
a second-class object. With `index`, the result is first class. But for
`Cons`, we would want the head to be first class and the tail to match
the class of the cons cell.
