# Named Function Arguments

I've been writing a little bit of python recently (mostly dataframe stuff
with pyarrow), and I have enjoying named function parameters. I have been
thinking about the challenges involved in adding the feature to a more
lambda-calculus-like language. I found some good concerns listed an answer given
by [latkde](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/17o9fwa/should_rust_have_namedoptional_parameters/)
on a reddit thread. That thread is specifically about adding named arguments
to rust, but a lot of the ABI concerns are relevant for any language that
is AOT compiled.

## Motivating Examples

Here's an example of a set of posix functions that are naturally expressed
with named parameters (from the man pages for `open(2)`):

    int open(const char *pathname, int flags, ...
               /* mode_t mode */ );
    int openat(int dirfd, const char *pathname, int flags, ...
               /* mode_t mode */ );

What would be nice is something like this:

    open : (String, I32, mode : Mode, at : I32) -> Result Errno I32

The default for `mode` is zero, and the default for `at` is `AT_FDCWD`.
Several other posix functions have an `*at()` variant (e.g. `unlink`).

## Implementation

How should this be implemented? Here are several options that I am aware of:

* Put all of the named arguments into a struct together and then pass
  a pointer to the struct.
