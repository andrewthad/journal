# Possible Next Steps

I have given up on using subtyping (with a top type) to hide region type
variables in type signatures. Here are some other things that would make
my experimental language more ergonomic:

* Simple inference of type variables. I've done this before in a different
  project, and it's not very difficult. I should add staging to all of my
  types when I do this. Right now, I've got a weird system where annotations
  get adding for projection so that the C backend works. I should clean it up.
* Relaxing ANF. Full ANF is helpful when lowering to assembly directly,
  but I am lowering to C. A relaxed ANF is only possible when all primitives
  can be lowered to C expressions. I may need to define inline C functions
  for certain primitives, particularly arithmetic that performs overflow
  checks.
