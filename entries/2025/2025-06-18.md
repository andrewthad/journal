# POSIX Standard Library for Language

There is a single canonical form for send, but there are two forms for
receive:

    send     : {r} -> Fd -> Array@r U8 -> World* -> (World*, Errno)
    recvInto : {r} -> Alloc r -> Fd -> World* -> (World*, Result Errno (Array@r U8))
    recv     : Fd -> World* -> (World*, Result Errno (Array U8))

It is not possible to unify the implementations of `recvInto` and `recv`. They
work differently. When receiving data into a region, we check to see how much
space is available in the region's active block. Then, we receive, at most,
that many bytes. Receiving into a reference-counted array is different. We
need to check for available contiguous memory, temporarily acquire exclusive
access to it, perform the `recv` syscall, then release any of the unused
memory. We will end up with this same split for all POSIX functions that
returns bytes. I think this is fine.
