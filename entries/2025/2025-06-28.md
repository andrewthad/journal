# Proofs Needed for Apache Arrow ListView

Apache Arrow has a ListView encoding. From the docs, consider an example
array of lists of `Int8`:

    [[12, -7, 25], null, [0, -127, 127, 50], []]

It would be encoded like this (again, copied directly from the documentation):

    * Length: 4, Null count: 1
    * Validity bitmap buffer:
      | Byte 0 (validity bitmap) | Bytes 1-63            |
      |--------------------------|-----------------------|
      | 00001101                 | 0 (padding)           |
    * Offsets buffer (int32)
      | Bytes 0-3  | Bytes 4-7   | Bytes 8-11  | Bytes 12-15 | Bytes 16-63           |
      |------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-----------------------|
      | 0          | 7           | 3           | 0           | unspecified (padding) |
    * Sizes buffer (int32)
      | Bytes 0-3  | Bytes 4-7   | Bytes 8-11  | Bytes 12-15 | Bytes 16-63           |
      |------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-----------------------|
      | 3          | 0           | 4           | 0           | unspecified (padding) |
    * Values array (Int8Array):
      * Length: 7,  Null count: 0
      * Validity bitmap buffer: Not required
      * Values buffer (int8)
        | Bytes 0-6                    | Bytes 7-63            |
        |------------------------------|-----------------------|
        | 12, -7, 25, 0, -127, 127, 50 | unspecified (padding) |

What does this look like with proofs about sizes and indices? It's not enough
to say that we have an index that is less than some upper bound. We need a
proof that related two elements of distinct arrays with a number. It looks
like this (syntax is inspired by GHC):

    data ListView : Nat -> Type -> Type where
      ListViewConstructor :
        { m : Nat
        , offsets : Array n Nat
        , sizes   : Array n Nat
        , values  : Array m a 
        , proof   : (i : Nat) -> (i < n) -> (index(offsets,i) + index(sizes,i) <= m)
        } -> List n a

We might want the proof to look like this instead:

    proof : (i : {Nat | ? < n}) -> (index(offsets,i) + index(sizes,i) <= m)

The proof is a function that is stored inside a data type, but it has no
representation at runtime. One difficulty with this is that we need `Nat`
to be a 32-bit type. I don't think that is too difficult to manage. Also,
we need definitional equalities to propagate automatically. For example:

    let offset = index(offsets,j)
    let size = index(sizes,j)
    let p = proof(j) : (offset + size <= m)

When used as part of a type, `offset` should expand to `index(offsets,j)`.
And then `j`, in turn, might expand to something else depending on how it
was defined.

Relatedly, what should the type signature of `copy` be? For `index`, it's
nice to have this:

    index : Array n a -> {Nat | ? < n} -> a

This is convenient in the common case because the proof is paired with the
index itself. But for copying a range of elements, we need to specify a
relationship between two values:

    copy : MArray dn a -> (di : Nat) -> Array sn a -> (si : Nat) -> (n : Nat) -> 
           (di + n <= dn) -> (si + n <= sn) -> State{1} -> State{1}

There is another way to describe this:

    copy : MArray dn a -> Array sn a -> (n : Nat) ->
           {Nat | ? + n <= sn} -> {Nat | ? + n <= dn} ->
           State{1} -> State{1}

I like this strategy.

# Proof for Apache Arrow Var-Bin View Layout

This one is more difficult. Each element in the array looks like this:

    * Short strings, length <= 12
      | Bytes 0-3  | Bytes 4-15                            |
      |------------|---------------------------------------|
      | length     | data (padded with 0)                  |
    * Long strings, length > 12
      | Bytes 0-3  | Bytes 4-7  | Bytes 8-11 | Bytes 12-15 |
      |------------|------------|------------|-------------|
      | length     | prefix     | buf. index | offset      |

We need an unpacked variant type that looks something like this:

    data Element : (bufsLen : Nat) -> (bufs : Array bufsLen Nat) -> Type where
      Element
        { length : Nat
        , prefix : U8.[4]
        , other : if (length <= 12)
            then {bufIndex : {Nat | ? < bufs}, offset : Nat, proof : (index + offset <= index(bufs,bufIndex) }
            else {moreData : U8.[8]}
        }

For some reason, Arrow's view layout for variable binary data lets you attach
a variable number of additional buffers. The main issue with this formulation
is that it's hard to access the entire inlined payload if the length is less than
or equal to 12.
