# Region-Incomplete Types

I've been thinking more about how regions and value types interact. I think
I know how I want to proceed. Here's the system:

1. A type (user defined or built in) can have kind `Type` or kind `Base`.
   Types with kind `Base` need to be paired with a region: `Person@r`.
   So, the at-sign operator has kind `Base -> Region -> Type`.
2. A type's fields may reference the region argument just like they can
   reference ordinary type arguments.
3. Types have an additional property that indicates whether they are
   heap allocated or stack allocated. (Stack allocated types get inlined
   into other data constructors, the term "value types" might be more
   appropriate.) Heap-allocated types must have kind `Base`. Stack-allocated
   types may have either kind.
4. Constructing a heap-allocated value requires the `Alloc` effect for
   the corresponding region.

As a simplification to point 3, we could just give every type the kind `Base`.
Consider a type like this:

    struct Point = {x : S64, y : S64}

All constructed values of type `Point` would live in region zero. Now, all
types are more uniform.
