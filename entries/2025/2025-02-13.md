# When Are Newtypes Useful?

Newtypes are useful sometimes, but sometimes they get in the way. For example,
consider that on Linux x86-64, a file descriptor is just an i32 (only the
nonnegative range though). If we treat it as a different type, then we cannot
reuse an ordered map that only works with `i32` keys. In GHC Haskell, we
might try to encode this as:

    insert :: Coercible k Int32 => k -> v -> Map k v -> Map k v

I don't really like this solution.
