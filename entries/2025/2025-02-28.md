# Array-Passing Conventions in Nosk

I have been lowering programs to C code and building them with GCC, which
uses the System V ABI. Here are a few things that I have noticed:

* Specifically with GCC, returning a 16-byte struct with more than
  two members causes the struct to be spilled to the stack and then
  loaded into the two registers that are used to return values.
  This is bad, and it is preferrable to use a two-member struct.

I've written down more of this in a notebook, and I need to copy it into
this document.
