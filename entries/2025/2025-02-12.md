# Motivating Problem

I need to think of a small application that I could write that will force
me to build out more of the primitives in nosk. Here are some avenues to
explore:

* Something involving filesystem management. Possibly a hard-drive backup
  tool to replace the one that I currently use. This involves hashes,
  read/write IO, hard linking, and building a file for hash reuse. It
  requires me to make a decision about how file paths should be represented.
* A postgres management tool. Something that accepts a database schema and
  then brings the schema up to date if columns are missing. This requires
  implementing the postgres wire protocol, which might be difficult. It
  also might require thinking about ktls or abstracting about the file
  descriptor to support encryption.
* An HTTP interceptor that logs information about the requests
* An HTTP stress test application
* A bitmap generator for stitching tiles together
* Something for querying ELF files

Here are some others:

* Serve files from file system with HTTP. Support directory listings.
* Convert CSV to HTML.
* Something like grep but that searches at the file level (instead of at
  the line level) and lets you look for multiple keywords in the file.
