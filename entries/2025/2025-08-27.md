# Blog I Now Enjoy: nullprogram.com

Chris Wellons has a blog at https://nullprogram.com/ and it's got some
great stuff. Here are some entries that I've enjoyed:

* Raw Linux Threads via System Calls.
* My review of the C standard library in practice. I like this post because
  I already hate the C standard library, but Chris hates it much more
  knowledgeably than I do.
