# Explicit Upcasting

I have realized that, when lowering a program to C, it is useful to have
information about casts available. For struct-like things where all the
variants are the same size, the C code does not need casts. But for
data represented by pointers, the casts are helpful. If we do not have
casts available, we must, at the site of each projection, downcast the
pointer to the correct type.
